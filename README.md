# Bass-Fishing-Project
This is a project combining bass fishing data from my 2022 fishing outings, with local daily weather data from the MeteoStat API.
The goals of this project were to uncover meaningful conclusions from my years bass fishing outings via t tests, visualizations and some basic classification
The project is useful to me as it showed that I caught more fish in the AM than the PM and that the weights of my 5 fish bags were positively correlated with water temperature.
To start using this project, play around with the parameters of the functions written in main.py and called in Project.ipynb. Try including and excluding certain columns and instances to see how it changes the results and yields you the information you are looking for.
You can get help with this dataset from google, or from me directly at jbarone@zagmail.gonzaga.edu.
I maintain and use this dataset for myself personally, but feel free to copy or use any of the code and data from this project for any of your coding needs, provided they sit on a good ethical framework.
Finally, please remember to be safe and follow all regulations of you area when fishing and applying any of the findings you may come across from your use of this project.
